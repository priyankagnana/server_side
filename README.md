# 📚 CampusConnect – A Social and Professional Network for Our College Community

> A unified platform to connect students, alumni, and faculty for collaboration, communication, and career growth.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of **CampusConnect** is to create a secure digital ecosystem where members of the college community can:
- Build a **college-exclusive social network**
- Enable **senior–junior mentorship and guidance**
- Facilitate **academic collaboration** through study rooms and discussions
- Share **updates, reels, posts, and achievements**

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Students currently use multiple scattered platforms for different needs:
- **WhatsApp** → Groups and updates  
- **Instagram** → Media sharing  
- **LinkedIn** → Professional networking  
- **Telegram/Discord** → Study discussions  

These platforms:
- Are **not college-specific**
- Are **difficult to manage collectively**
- **Lack privacy and academic relevance**

Hence, there’s a need for a **dedicated platform** where only verified college members can join using their **official email IDs**.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

CampusConnect unifies social and professional features into one secure ecosystem.

### 🔑 Key Features
- ✅ Login with **official college email (email verification)**
- 👤 **Profile creation** – bio, course, batch, interests, skills  
- 💬 **Chat system** – 1:1 and group chats using Socket.io  
- 🧠 **Study rooms** – topic-based academic discussions  
- 📰 **Feed section** – posts, updates, reels  
- 🎯 **Event board** – internships, hackathons, workshops
